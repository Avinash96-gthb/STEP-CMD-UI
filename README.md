# CMD â€“ Clinic Management Dashboard (Frontend)

This is the iOS frontend for **CMD (Clinic Management Dashboard)**, a case study project for the **STEP â€“ Simply Training Education Program**.

It is built using **UIKit** with fully programmatic UI and utilizes modern Swift concurrency (`async/await`). The app enables users to create new clinics and fetch all existing clinics from a backend API.

## ðŸ§ª Backend API

This app interacts with two main endpoints:

- `GET /clinics` â€“ Fetch all clinics
- `POST /clinics` â€“ Create a new clinic

> The backend repository will be available soon.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- macOS with Xcode installed (Xcode 15 or later recommended)
- An Apple Silicon or Intel Mac for development

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cmd-ios-frontend.git
cd cmd-ios-frontend

# 2. Open the project in Xcode

# 3. Build and Run
